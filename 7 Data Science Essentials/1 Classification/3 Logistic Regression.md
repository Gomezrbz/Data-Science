# Statistical Learning Theory for Supervised Learning

The Okham's Razor
>The best models are simple models that fit the data well.

There is a way to kind of grade the models and this is by a very simple table like this:

| Complexity   |Result	  |
| :---:   |:---:  |
| Simple Models      |Underfitting |
| Middle Complexity  	  |Good Models|
| More Complex Models  	  |Overfitting |

You want to look for the sweet spot between a low Training Error and Test Error, in other terms you want a balance between accuracy and simplicity. This is the Principle of Okham's Razor.
