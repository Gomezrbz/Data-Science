# Getting started with data

### Kind of Data	
* Temporal: __Dates and times__
* Text: __String data, sometimes it is categorical__
* Numeric
	- Continuous __Are measurements in a scale__
	- Discrete __It is a measurement to count__

### Sort and Filter
Sorting your data may be a good way to find some **mistakes** if there are any, like mistapes of prices and all that sort of things. Also by filtering your
data can help you to know more how is your data **status**

### Derived Data
This kind of data is the one you get by knowing the context of the data you received, for exmple:

In this **table you can see there is the price and number of sales of a certain product, of course if I ask you if you now the **revenue** of the sales you could know it
by simply multiplying __price*sales__.

| Price   | Sales|
| :---:   | :---:|
| 37      | 2    |
| 34  	  | 23   |
| 55  	  | 45   |
| 80 	  | 50   |

The operation of the revenue as it was said would have the opportunity of creating a new column called **renue** in which will be the result of the operation. In summary
this is the derived data. The **table** would be like this:

| Price   | Sales| Revenue |
| :---:   | :---:|:---:	   |
| 37      | 2    | 74      |
| 34  	  | 23   |782	   |
| 55  	  | 45   |2475	   |
| 80 	  | 50   |4000	   |
